When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When I need to access the repository from a different computer or share work
    with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Becasue you can control when you wish to sync them.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Fork: When I don't have the permission to edit the original repo directly.
	This will create a copy of the repo within Github.
	Clone: When I need to make a copy of a repo - work within Git or Github.
	Branch: In the local when we keep the master branch (say for production) and
	create a new branch for development.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    You can trace difference and do merging with the local repo while you are offline.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Use email to notify partners about the changes and requests to merge.
	Easier: easier to implement
	Harder: harder to track and is error prone as those could be easily fall off one's radar.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    When: When different people are working on different area of a project and they are collaborating.
	Benefit of keeping in master: less work when it comes to syncing the local and remote.
	Benefit of separately in branch: can keep the master intact until people involved has a chance
	to review and merge branch to the master. More room and flexibility to support collaboration.
